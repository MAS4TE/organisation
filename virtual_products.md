# Virtual products
Virtual products are defined by some flexible (e. g. prosumer specific) and some fixed (e. g. given by market) characteristics. Below is a list of those characteristics for each [Phase](https://github.com/MAS4TE/organisation/blob/main/media/mas4te-configuration-phase-fhac.png).

## Phase 1
In Phase 1 we want to provide a simple, single product, which will be defined below.

**Fixed characteristics:**
* Timeframe (e. g. time one can rent a storage for): set to one week
* Efficiency: 95%. Buyer of storage has to account for losses (e. g. only receiving 95% of stored energy back)
* Fill level: Storage will be received AND returned with 50% state of charge.
* C-Rate: Charge- and discharge power in relation to the volume (e. g. volume: 10 kWh + c-rate: 2 == 20 kW, volume: 50 kWh + c-rate: 0.5 == 25 kW)

**Flexible characteristics:**
* Price: 0.01 â‚¬/kWh steps
* Capacity: 0.1 kWh steps
